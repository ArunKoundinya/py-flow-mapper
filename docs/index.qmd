PyFlowMapper is a lightweight static analysis tool that reads your Python source code (without running it) and produces metadata + diagrams that explain **which functions call which**, and **how values move through your project**.

## Why PyFlowMapper?

Most call-graph tools show *connections*, but not the *data story*.

PyFlowMapper goes a step further by tracking common pipeline-style data flow between functions, helping you understand real execution intent and not just structure.

## What It Does

- Parses Python code using AST (no execution)
- Detects functions, classes, and imports
- Builds call graphs and reverse-call maps
- Tracks basic data flow via return assignments
- Outputs metadata and Mermaid diagram.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArunKoundinya/py-flow-mapper.git
cd py-flow-mapper
pip install -e .
```
or 

```bash
pip install py-flow-mapper
```

## Quickstart

### Analyze a Project

```bash
pyflow analyze /path/to/project
```

Creates `project_meta.json`.

### Generate Diagrams

```bash
pyflow diagram /path/to/project/project_meta.json
```

### View Structure

```bash
pyflow structure /path/to/project
```

## Python API

```python
from pyflowmapper import ProjectAnalyzer, MermaidGenerator

analyzer = ProjectAnalyzer(base_path="/path/to/project", entry_point="main.py")
analyzer.analyze()

generator = MermaidGenerator("/path/to/project/project_meta.json")
generator.generate_all_diagrams()
```

## Tips

- Start small to understand output
- Use `--entry-point` if main file is not `main.py`
- Mermaid diagrams render well in GitHub and Quarto
